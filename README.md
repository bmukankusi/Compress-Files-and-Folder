# Compress files and folders

# How the program works
1. Upon running the program, a user is prompted to enter a path to a file to compress
2. After entering the path to the file, a user is prompted to choose a type that the file will be compressed into.
       (ex: .zip, .tzig, tar)
3. A user choose a type from the options
4. The file gets compressed successfully
5. If the file fails, the program gives an error message to a user.
